               INT. THEODORE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               A jolly figure in red appears in the darkness.

                                   THEODORE
                         Santa?! But it's not Christmas yet!

                                   SANTA
                         It's December-ish. But anyway, shut
                         up. Under the guise of "The Holiday
                         Season", society has forgotten the
                         true meaning of Christmas.

                                   THEODORE
                         Oh no! Is there a war on Christmas?

                                   SANTA
                         That's absolutely what I would say.

                                                                CUT TO:



               EXT. HIGH STREET - NIGHT

                                   SANTA
                         Quick Theodore, a poisonous holly
                         wreath on every door!

                                   THEODORE
                         Wait, are these laced with ricin?

                                                                CUT TO:



               EXT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT

                                   SANTA
                         There, we covered every household.

                                   THEODORE
                         Santa, I've been thinking. Isn't
                         "The Holiday Season" just society's
                         attempt to be more accepting and
                         tolerant of other cultures and
                         religions?

                                   SANTA
                         And that is why they must die. You
                         see, tonight I enacted my master
                         plan: the Holly-Claust. Didn't you
                         know of my historical Germanic
                         roots? And also I'm a Nazi.
