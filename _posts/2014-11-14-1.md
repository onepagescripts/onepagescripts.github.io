               INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - DAY

               A group of WORRIED ADVISORS sit hunched around a long table
               with PRESIDENT HARRISON FORD. The mood is serious.

                                   WORRIED ADVISOR #1
                         Mr. President, I'm afraid the
                         zombies have taken New York, and
                         Los Angeles. It's only a matter of
                         time before they reach Washington.

                                   PRESIDENT HARRISON FORD
                         What is this, a Million Man
                         March... for ZOMBIES?!

                                   WORRIED ADVISOR #1
                         I'm afraid their numbers far exceed
                         that, Mr. President...

                                                                CUT TO:



               INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

               The room is riddled with zombies who surround PRESIDENT
               HARRISON FORD. ZOMBIE CLINT EASTWOOD leans in mouth agape.

                                   PRESIDENT HARRISON FORD
                             (kicking helplessly)
                         GET OFF MY BRAIN!

                                                                CUT TO:



               INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

               ZOMBIE PRESIDENT HARRISON FORD sits stoically at his desk,
               while a ZOMBIE CAMERAMAN adjusts the lens of a TV camera.

                                   ZOMBIE PRESIDENT HARRISON FORD

               INT. AVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILY LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

                                   DAD
                         I can't believe we've got 4 more
                         years of this...
