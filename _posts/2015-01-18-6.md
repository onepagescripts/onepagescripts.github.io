               EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

                                   BABY DUFRESNE
                         What am I in for? Infanticide.

                                   BABY RED
                         You killed another baby?

                                   BABY DUFRESNE
                         It's funny, on the outside I was an
                         honest baby - apart from that whole
                         baby killing thing. I had to come
                         to Baby Prison to be a crook.

                                   BABY RED
                         Get busy living, or get busy
                         crying.

                                                                CUT TO:



               EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

               Group of babies tarring a roof, supervised by CAPTAIN BABELY.

                                   BABY DUFRESNE
                         Mr Babely. Do you trust your mommy?

                                   CAPTAIN BABELY
                         That's funny. You're gonna look
                         funnier sucking my dick with no
                         fuckin' teeth.

                                   BABY DUFRESNE
                         I don't have any teeth.

                                                                CUT TO:



               EXT. FIELD OUTSIDE PRISON - NIGHT

                                   BABY RED (V.O.)
                         Baby Dufresne - who crawled through
                         a river of shit, because he
                         couldn't walk.

               Sound of dogs barking, they approach BABY DUFRESNE.

                                   BABY DUFRESNE
                         Ooh, nice doggy.

               BABY DUFRESNE gently pats each dog in turn.
