           INT. MILITARY RECRUITING OFFICE (2002) - DAY

           There is a large line of men waiting to sign up. A HORSE and
           his WRANGLER are at the front of the queue.

                                   RECRUITER #1
                      Look buddy, we're more than happy to
                      sign you up. But a horse?! This ain't
                      the cavalry, this is the United States
                      Marines!

                                   WRANGLER
                      He's a good horse. He just wants to
                      serve his country. 

           A second recruiter returns to the desk with a large book.

                                   RECRUITER #2
                      He's right! Ain't no rules say a horse
                      can't fight in a war.

                                   MAN IN QUEUE
                      I don't wanna serve with a Clydesdale!

                                                                    CUT TO:

           EXT. IRAQ (2006) - DAY

           Three soldiers are hiding from a sniper behind a destroyed
           tank. Their commanding officer is talking on a radio.

                                   MAJOR
                      We need backup! We can't hold out any
                      longer!

                                   PRIVATE
                      I wanna go home! I can't take this, I
                      just wanna go home!

           A drone emerges from the clouds and fires a missile, blowing
           up the snipers. The company cheer in appreciation.

                                                                    CUT TO:

           INT. QUIET OFFICE - NIGHT

           The horse is standing at the controls of the drone, seemingly
           oblivious. A passing superior feeds him a sugar cube.

                                   SUPERIOR
                      That's damn fine work soldier.

           The horse whinnys. 

           SUPERIMPOSE: "SERGEANT PATCH'S EXEMPLARY SERVICE LATER PAVED THE
           WAY FOR HORSES TO BE INTEGRATED INTO THE ARMY, NAVY AND
           AIRFORCE."
