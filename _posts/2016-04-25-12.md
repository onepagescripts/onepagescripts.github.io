                      It is 2183, farts have been outlawed.
                      Beans are a banned substance. Those
                      found in violation of this stringent
                      law are exiled to... "The Fart Zone".

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

          A busy military control room, manned by armed forces in black
          uniforms. A high-pitched beeping begins to emanate from one of
          the consoles. COMMANDER PENZORB rushes over to the console, the
          OPERATOR looks confused.

                                   OPERATOR
                      Sir, I'm detecting a breach in sector
                      F9XZ1.

                                   COMMANDER PENZORB
                      F9XZ1? But that's impossible...

                                   OPERATOR
                      I've triple checked the readings, sir.

                                   COMMANDER PENZORB
                      But that's deep in... The Fart Zone...

          Commander Penzorb focuses on the console and has a flashback to
          the great war.

          EXT. DYSTOPIAN FUTURE TRENCHES - DAY

          YOUNG PENZORB and a platoon are firing laser rifles into a
          cloud of smoke. The return fire ceases, it's eerily quiet.

                                   YOUNG PENZORB
                      Hm, they must've run out of ammo...

          The PLATOON COMMANDER looks wary, he begins to smell the air.

                                   PLATOON COMMANDER
                      IT'S A GAS ATTACK!

          He collapses into a seizure as the soldiers look on, horrified.

          DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

          Penzorb shakes himself out of it.

                                   COMMANDER PENZORB
                      Initiate Golden Cork Protocol. NOW!
