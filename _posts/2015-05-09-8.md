           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           Names are read out and the jury box is filled. An uncalled
           juror addresses an attractive woman sitting in front of him.

                                   MATTHEW
                      Always the potential juror, never the
                      juror, right?!

                                   JUDGE
                      Order in the court! Unselected jurors
                      remain in SILENCE until I dismiss you.

                                   MATTHEW
                      Judge, Judy and executioner over
                      here...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

                                   MATTHEW
                      Rebecca! Boy, you run fast down those
                      steps, you're like a reverse Rocky.

                                   REBECCA
                      Oh hey, were you in the jury?

                                   MATTHEW
                      I like how you conducted yourself in
                      there; listen, fancy a coffee?

                                   LAWYER
                      Excuse me, miss, please avoid this
                      man. He's a pickup artist. We can't
                      ban him, it's a public gallery...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

                                   MATTHEW
                      Rebecca, this week of fake 
                      jury duty would have been painful if
                      it wasn't for you. Will you marry me?!

                                   JUDGE
                      This is highly unusual, and I'm not
                      going to allow it. You can't get
                      married in court, only sentenced to
                      life imprisonment.

                                   MATTHEW
                      That's what I'm saying!

                                                           SMASH CUT TO:

           END CREDITS.
