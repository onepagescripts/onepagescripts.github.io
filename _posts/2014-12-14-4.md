               INT. CUBICLE FARM (2016) - DAY/NIGHT

                                   HEAD OF DIGITAL
                         But dammit Sebastian, you're the
                         best we have. You've programmed
                         half of the Internet.

                                   SEBASTIAN
                             (cocky smirk)
                         Yeah, the good half.

                                   HEAD OF DIGITAL
                         You're the only one who can stop
                         North Korea, they've hacked
                         everything.

                                   SEBASTIAN
                         And how is this my battle? The only
                         people I care about are virtual,
                         and myself of course.
                         Tell you what: I'll flip a byte.
                         Ones and zeros are the only true
                         logic in this crazy world...

               SEBASTIAN flips a byte, the outcome is unclear.

                                   SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
                         I guess it's war time.

                                                                CUT TO:



               INT. SEBASTIAN'S CUBICLE - DAY/NIGHT

               Sound of mouse clicks and keyboard tapping.

                                   SEBASTIAN
                         Hm.

               One and a half more hours of this.

                                   SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
                         OK finished.

               SEBASTIAN takes off his UV, anti-glare glasses.

                                   SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
                         I guess you could say I pressed
                         Ctrl+Alt+Del on this war.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
