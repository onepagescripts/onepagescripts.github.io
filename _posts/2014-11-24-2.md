               INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

               A couple wake up in their marital bed. A framed picture by
               the bedside show them to be smiling, in their mid-40s, and on
               a rollercoaster.

                                   BARBARA
                         Jim. Jim, you're going to be late
                         for work.

                                   JIM
                         Mnggh, I don't want to go to school
                         today.

                                   BARBARA
                             (leaping out of bed)
                         WAAARGH! Little boy, you're not my
                         middle-aged husband!

                                   JIM
                         Honey, relax. It was a joke.

               BARBARA holds up a mirror to JIM, showing him to be a little
               12-year old boy.

                                   JIM (CONT'D)
                         Oh my god! I'm SMALL!

                                                                CUT TO:



               INT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY

                                   JIM
                         What do you mean you can't sell me
                         a bottle of Jack Daniels? I'm in
                         here every day! Can't you remember
                         I'm an alcoholic?

                                   CASHIER
                         Like I told you, I ain't sellin' no
                         Jack Daniels to no kids.

                                   JIM
                         well I'm not a kid! Plus your
                         statement implies that you do in
                         fact sell alcohol to kids.

               JIM makes a frustrated gesture and turns to exit. He spots a
               poster saying "HIGH SCHOOL SIGNUPS TODAY! (children only)"

                                   JIM (CONT'D)
                         Looks like I will be going to
                         school after all...
