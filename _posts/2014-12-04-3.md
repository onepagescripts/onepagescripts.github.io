               EXT. BUSY URBAN STREET - NIGHT

               Two friends are walking home, deep in conversation.

                                   THEODORE
                         I don't know what I'm saying Sam. I
                         guess I'm saying I'm done with this
                         town. I need to be true to myself
                         as an artist.

                                   SAM
                         And that means moving to the
                         sticks?

                                   THEODORE
                         It's what the sticks are attached
                         to: trees. Lots of great writers
                         worked in secluded settings.

                                                                CUT TO:



               INT. LOG CABIN - DAY

               THEODORE takes a deep breath and exhales just as deeply while
               staring out of a large window at a great vista of trees,
               mountains, and one really nice bush.

                                   THEODORE
                         This is exactly what I need to
                         write the next great American
                         novel.

               THEODORE sits down at a sturdy oak desk and carefully loads
               his Corona No. 3 typewriter with a single blank page. He
               pauses.

                                   THEODORE (CONT'D)
                         Hmm. Actually, come to think of it,
                         this is more or less the exact same
                         situation that I had in my modest
                         apartment in the city. I'm still
                         just a man at a typewriter. 
                         My circumstance haven't changed at
                         all. Being in nature hasn't
                         improved me as a writer. The only
                         difference is now I have no mobile
                         phone signal.

               A wolf howls in the distance.
