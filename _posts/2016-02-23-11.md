           INT. CAR - DAY

           Two KIDS are sitting in a car looking just as bored as their
           PARENTS in the front.

                                   DAUGHTER
                      I'm bored!

                                   FATHER
                      Hi Bored, I'm Mark, your father.

                                   DAUGHTER
                      Dad! 

           The father and mother laugh to themselves.

                                   DAUGHTER
                          (annoyed)
                      No, dad! I mean I'm bored!

                                   SON
                      I wanna play a game.

           Short silence as the kids look around the car.

                                   DAUGHTER
                      Oh! Oh! I spy with my little eye...

           The father whips his head around to look into the back seat.

                                   FATHER
                      You're a SPY?!

           Father slams on the breaks as the mother frantically searches
           through the glovebox. The children are in total shock.

                                   MOTHER
                      Fuck! ...FUCK! I knew it! I fucking
                      KNEW IT!

                                   FATHER
                      CALM DOWN HELEN. FUCKING CALM DOWN. We
                      have this under control. We have this-

                                   DAUGHTER
                      Daddy?!

                                   FATHER
                      Shut your commie mouth you bitch!

           The children are crying as the mother brings a 9mm out of the
           glovebox. The parents exit the car. The camera freezes.

                                   NARRATOR
                      Yep. The cold war sure was a crazy
                      time for a teenager to grow up.

           FADE OUT.
