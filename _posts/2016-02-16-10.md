           INT. BRITISH SUBMARINE - NIGHT

           The deck is manned by NAVAL OFFICERS and a particularly stern
           looking CAPTAIN. It is dimly lit by green sonar consoles.

                                   SONAR OFFICER
                      Captain, it's been 3 days, we can't
                      hold out much longer.

                                   CAPTAIN
                          (quietly)
                      Silence! We must maintain stealth... 

                                   SIGNALS OFFICER
                          (quietly)
                      Captain I have something! I think you
                      need to hear this!

           The officer disconnects his console's headphones.

                                   SPEAKERS
                      O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum, wie treu
                      sind deine Blatter...

                                   SONAR OFFICER
                      It's a Christmas truce! Just like
                      during the great war of 1914!

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. GERMAN SUBMARINE

           As the crew sing Christmas carols the GERMAN OFFICER begins
           waving frantically to the crew.

                                   GERMAN OFFICER
                      It has worked! Ze British are singing
                      back to us! A truce!

           The crew rise to their feet cheering. The captain produces a
           leather skinned football from under his desk as everyone heads
           towards an exit sign, grabbing their coats and hats.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. MIDDLE OF THE SEA - 1 HOUR LATER

           Both crews are floating lifeless in the middle of the ocean,
           some wearing football kits and scarfs. Their submarines are
           slowly sinking behind them. The football has been crumpled by
           the pressure and is floating near the dead captains who are
           wearing Santa hats. 

           FADE OUT.
